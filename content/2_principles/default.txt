Title: Principles

----

Text:

* **Keep It Planty!** Celebrate plants in every project, letting nature inspire and ground our work.
* **Think Native-ish.** Support our local roots, but see the world in all its colors. Stay curious, adaptable, and open-minded — we are all in this together.
* **Stay Grounded, Not Invasive-ish.** Take action, be principled, don’t dominate and remember humble is a verb.
* **Get Your Hands Dirty.** Make things… by hand. Wear gloves, if needed. Remember, screens are for printing, too. 
* **Shape the Story** Someone famous once said “All the World's a Stage.” The narrative is yours to write. Craft it with pride.
* **Less is More, More or Less.** Simplify. Simplify. Simplify?
* **It’s Ok to Be Critical.** Sometimes things suck. Listen to constructive feedback, reflect, and ask questions. Break things; build them up again.
* **Keep On Keeping On…** Nevertheless, they persisted.
* **Heck Yeah! ** Embrace the Funk! Bring energy and enthusiasm to every project especially when pushing through challenges. Heck Yeah!
* **Cultivate Our Garden, Voltaire Style.** Principles are meant to be broken. Nurture what’s right in front of you.
